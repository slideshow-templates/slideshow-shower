## Slide Show (S9) Template Pack - Shower (Ribbon Theme)

The [Shower](https://github.com/pepelsbey/shower) package by Vadim Makeev bundled up into 
a Slide Show (S9) template pack.

Note, the package is configured to use the following headers in `slides.html.erb`:

    author: Your Name Here
    title: Your Slide Show Title Here
 
## Try It Yourself - How To Use the Template Pack

If you want to try it yourself, install (fetch) the new template pack. Issue the command:

    $ slideshow -f https://github.com/geraldb/slideshow-shower/raw/master/shower.txt

To check if the new template got installed, use the `-l/--list` switch/command:

    $ slideshow -l

Listing something like:

    Installed templates include:
       shower.txt (/home/gerald/.slideshow/templates/shower/shower.txt)

Now you're ready to use it using the `-t/--template` switch. Example:

    $ slideshow -t shower.txt tutorial

That's it.
